# QuoteVault - Full Project Documentation & Speaker Notes

## Overview
QuoteVault is a MERN stack web application where users can share, explore, and save motivational quotes. 
It features optional password protection for quotes, a responsive UI, and a clean user experience with dark mode support.

This document serves both as **project documentation** and **presentation speaker notes**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the App
- Provide a dedicated platform for quotes (motivational, philosophical, personal).
- Allow users to add, edit, delete their quotes securely.
- Encourage sharing of wisdom and intellectual discussions.
- Example use case: A student adds an inspiring quote, protects it with a password, 
  and later edits it only after entering that password.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### MERN Stack
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store quotes.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for routing and APIs.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building UI components and pages.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to execute backend code.

### Additional Tools
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Axios** – HTTP client for API calls.
- **Vite** – Fast frontend build tool.
- **GitHub** – Version control and collaboration.
- **Vercel** – Frontend deployment.
- **Render** – Backend deployment.
- **React-Toastify** – Toast notifications.
- **Lucide-react / react-icons** – Icons.

## 📂 Project Structure

### Back-end (`/back-end`)
- `app.js` – Express server setup, routes, middleware.
- `db/connect.js` – MongoDB connection using Mongoose.
- `models/Quote.js` – Defines quote schema (title, content, author, tags, password).
- `models/User.js` – Defines user schema (prepared for login system, not active yet).
- `.env` – Stores secrets like DB URL, master password.

### Front-end (`/front-end`)
- `src/App.jsx` – Root component, sets up Router, Navbar, Footer, Toasts.
- `src/components/` – Reusable UI pieces like Navbar, Footer, QuoteCard, Modals.
- `src/pages/` – Each route’s main page (Home, About, AllQuotes, AddQuote, EditQuote, YourQuotes, SingleQuote).
- `src/index.css` – Global Tailwind + styles.
- `src/App.css` – Extra animations and visual effects.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- Browse quotes from all users.
- Add, edit, delete your own quotes.
- Password-protection for quotes (edit/delete only with correct password).
- "Quote of the Day" – rotates daily using a seeded random generator.
- Recent quotes carousel.
- Tags support for categorization.
- Responsive design (desktop/mobile).
- Automatic dark mode (based on browser settings).

## ⚙️ Backend API Overview

Base URL: `/api/v1/quotes`

- `GET /` → Welcome message.
- `GET /quotes` → List all quotes (without passwords).
- `POST /quotes` → Create new quote.
- `GET /quotes/:id` → Get a specific quote (requires password if protected).
- `PUT /quotes/:id` → Update a quote (requires password).
- `DELETE /quotes/:id` → Delete a quote (requires password).

**Password logic:**
- Public quote → accessible without password.
- Protected quote → requires matching password OR master password.
- Master password set in `.env`.

---

## 🎨 Frontend Behavior

- **Routing** handled with `react-router-dom`.
- **Axios** calls to backend APIs.
- **State** management with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **LocalStorage**:
  - Saves IDs of quotes you created → used for "Your Quotes" page.
- **Dark Mode**:
  - Toggle in Navbar, stored in LocalStorage, applied with Tailwind's `dark` mode.

---

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Backend
```bash
cd back-end
cp .env.example .env   # configure DB URI, PORT, MASTER_PASSWORD
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd front-end
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔒 Security Notes
- Currently, quote passwords are stored in **plain text**. For real production, use `bcrypt` to hash them (like User model does).
- `includePassword=true` query is powerful → restrict to admins in the future.

---

## 📈 Challenges & Learnings
- Deployment on Render and Vercel took debugging of build settings.
- Handling predefined libraries improved my confidence with Node + React ecosystem.
- Learned modular structuring of React components and Express routes.
- Understood real-world importance of having an online platform.

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Full login/signup system (JWT + bcrypt).
- User account pages with profile & saved quotes.
- Advanced search by author/tags.
- Like & comment system for engagement.
- Option to add images or videos with quotes.
- Stronger security for password-protected content.

## 🎤 Speaker Notes for Presentation

When presenting:
1. **Start with the problem** → “We often see quotes on social media but no dedicated space for sharing them.”
2. **Introduce QuoteVault** → “A MERN stack app for motivational and intellectual quotes.”
3. **Explain each technology** simply → database, backend, frontend, runtime.
4. **Walk through features** with small real examples (adding a quote, editing with password).
5. **Highlight challenges** you faced and how you overcame them.
6. **Future scope** → stress login system, user engagement features.
7. **Conclude confidently** → “This project gave me hands-on experience in full-stack development and confidence in deploying real-world apps.”
